# Prepdroid_AndroidApp
My first application, made to be used by students at St. Peter's Prep, Jersey City, NJ.

I made this when I first got interested in programming. It was my very first personal project. I actually built the entire thing during finals week of my junior year in high school, 2014.

The apk is available for download at:
